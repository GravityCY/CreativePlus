# CreativePlus
A Mod that makes it easier to be creative in Minecraft

## Spawning Entities GUI
Spawning Entities no longer requires a command, it can easily be done with a Creative like Menu but for entities!
> * Base Entity Screen

> * Screen for Customizing NBT Options that are unique to each entity, which can be easily visualized!

> * Visually setting the position of the entity!

> * Spawning the entity with the /summon command or copying the /summon command with the NBT options you've chosen!
>  * Want to spawn a specific entity with a specific position with specific NBT
    in a custom map? Great! Don't manually choose the ID of the entity and location with JUST the 
    command auto-complete, use this, visually choose your location, and visually see your entity's NBT options!
